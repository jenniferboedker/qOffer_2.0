/**
 * Update offer use case.
 *
 * During the offer preparation, the customer might request changes for the offer items (number of
 * samples, change in the technology used for analysis, etc.).
 * The offer manager provides an interface to update an existing offer and create a new version
 * from it.
 *
 * In the process of updating an existing offer, the updated one has the same offer identifier
 * as the original one, with the one exception that the version modifier has been increased.
 *
 * @since: 1.0.0
